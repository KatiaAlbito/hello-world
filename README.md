# hello-world

I'm so happy to meet you! :woman:

And who am I you may wonder?

Well long story short because long intros are for blog posts and interviews :smile:

My name is Katia, I'm a twenty-something yeard old woman who 6 years ago had the mindblowing opportunity of studying abroad, packed her bags and moved to Canada to study ... \<drum rolls\> ... Mathematics!
  
While studying math, I discovered coding and particularly data manipulation were fascinating to me :computer: I'd happily spend hours cracking, debugging or improving my coding assignments than doing my laundry or meal prepping for the week haha. 
  
4 years of university, 2 years working, a pandemic, and many existential crises later I found myself looking for a way to put myself, my skills and my passions outhere in the world. And this is why I opened this Github account, to share with you some of my projects -related to data because that's what I am passionate about-  and join this community.
I'm also passionate about digital illustration so if you have a minute, you can check out my Instagram where I post all my illustrations [@drawnbykatia](https://www.instagram.com/drawnbykatia/)
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my intro :)
